\title{LessPermutation: to reduce permutation times by fitting generalized pareto distribution of the right tail data}
\usage{
LessPermutation(X, x0, fitting.method = "mle", search.step = 0.01,
  fit.cutoff = 0.05, when.to.fit = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{a vector of data recording the permutation values}

\item{x0}{observed value}

\item{fitting.method}{method to fit GPD, default is "mle", alternative "gd"(gradient descend)}

\item{search.step}{the length of step (this param * length(X)) to find threshold. Default 0.01}

\item{fit.cutoff}{the cutoff of p value to judge whether it fits well to GPD, default is 0.05}

\item{when.to.fit}{a cutoff to tell how many sample values are bigger than the target value then we don't need to fit GPD. it is a portion.Default 0.05}
}
\value{
p value of the observed value in the permutation test
}
